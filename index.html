        Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change. - Stephen Hawking <br><br>

        "The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena; 
        whose face is marred with dust and sweat; who strives valiantly, 
        who errs and fall again and again, because there is no effort without error or shortcomings" - Theodore Roosevelt <br><br>
        
        Hi, my name is Paoge Moua.  I was born and raise in the Twin Cities! Go Vikings! 
        I went to St. Olaf College for my undergraduate study, and graduated in 2015 with a liberal arts degree.  
        Shortly after graduating, I work in various industries, specifically the culinary, non-profit, IT, retail management 
        and entrepreneurship.  From these experiences, I've learn three things about myself - 1) I'm a life-long learner, 
        2) I crave creative outlets and spontaneity, and 3) I love to lead and be apart of a strong team.
        
        For the next chapter in my life, I want to thrive in these areas.  
        I want to lead a resilient and spontaneous team that is passionate about learning and helping other succeed. 
        The next 6 months will be springboard to finding this team.
